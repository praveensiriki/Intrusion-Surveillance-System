# Real-Time Face Detection Intrusion Surveillance System

## Introduction
This project aims to develop an intrusion surveillance system capable of real-time face detection using a webcam. The system is designed to enhance security measures by promptly notifying users via email when a face is detected within the camera's field of view. Additionally, users have the option to record video clips of the detected faces for further analysis or reference.

## Features
- Real-time face detection using a webcam
- Email notifications with attached images upon face detection
- Ability to record video clips of detected faces
- User-friendly interface for easy configuration and monitoring

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV library
- Email account for sending notifications
- Webcam or compatible camera device

## Installation
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Install the required Python libraries using pip:
3. Configure the email settings in the `config.py` file.
4. Run the `main.py` script to start the surveillance system.

## Usage
